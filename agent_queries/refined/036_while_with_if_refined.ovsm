;; Query: Demonstrate IF-THEN-ELSE inside WHILE loop (the critical parser fix!)
;; Category: Loops - The Parser Bug Fix
;; Expected: 1 (integer)
;; Demonstrates: Explicit parentheses eliminate parser ambiguity

;; ⭐ THE CRITICAL FIX ⭐
;; In Python-style Solisp, this pattern caused infinite loops:
;;   WHILE condition:
;;       IF x THEN ... ELSE ...
;;       next_statement  <-- Parser incorrectly consumed this as part of ELSE!
;;
;; LISP syntax with explicit parentheses fixes this completely.

(define done false)   ;; Loop control variable
(define count 0)      ;; Counter to be incremented

(while (not done)
  ;; IF-THEN-ELSE block is explicitly delimited by parentheses
  (if (== count 0)
      (set! count 1)     ;; Then branch: set count to 1
      (set! count 2))    ;; Else branch: set count to 2

  ;; ✅ This statement executes AFTER the if block!
  ;; In Python-style Solisp, parser incorrectly included this in ELSE block
  (set! done true))

;; Result: count is 1 (took the THEN branch, then exited loop)
count

;; Why this works:
;; - Parentheses explicitly show where IF expression ends
;; - (set! done true) is clearly a sibling of the IF, not a child
;; - No ambiguity about indentation levels
